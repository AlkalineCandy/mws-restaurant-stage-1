# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## What is this project? 

It is a part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. It demonstrates that I, the creator, am able to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application that can be used offline, too. For more information, please visit the original repo from where this was forked. 

## Use 

The site displays a couple restauants that you can filter. Simply open `index.html`. 


## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

## Other dependencies
